Project Documentation
---------------------

During spring break, students traveled to Nicaragua to identify public health or medical needs that might be effectively addressed by appropriate medical technologies. Students interviewed key stakeholders, photographed target medical devices, and completed the Design Challenge Template to document their projects.

Upon returning from Nicaragua, students identified five final design projects. They formed teams, and were advised by expert mentors and course instructors. The second half of the semester focused on device design and prototyping that leveraged lessons learned from the first half of the course. The following blog entries catalogue student progress and final presentation of the group work. Teams created posters and displayed prototypes during a capstone poster session at the MIT Museum at the end of the semester.
