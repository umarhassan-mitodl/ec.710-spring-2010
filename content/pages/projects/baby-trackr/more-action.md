_by \[AB\]_
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You probably can't read the business card very well because the shot was taken from my iPhoneÂ® but Directora Terza Cristina Melo de Brito Carvalho is very interested in our prototype. She works at the Universidade de Sao Paulo and I'm going to e-mail her a copy of our poster. We should keep in contact with her and others interested for the future when we start making more prototypes. The last two pictures are from the EMG testing, and the few minutes that it worked before we realized it wasn't grounded properly on grace's arm. The rest are from the poster session (one with Amit's daughter testing it out), and a picture of the actual poster. I can also upload a file version of the poster soon. Enjoy the pics!
